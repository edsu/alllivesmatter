These project contains data files for tweets mentioning #AllLivesMatter that
were derived from a collection of 30 million tweets mentioning the word 
Ferguson housed at the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanties. The 
analysis was performed as part of a research collaboration between MITH and 
Rashawn Ray and Melissa Brown from the Sociology Department at the University 
of Maryland.
